# FloodGuard
Autonomous flood protection system, which can work for months from a single 18650 Li-ion battery.
Includes a battery charger as well as a HW monitoring circuit. Includes power MOSFET for external valve control circuit. Even if SW is stuck or microcontroller is dead you will hear beeping informing you that something is wrong.
Two protected guard inputs make a redundant and reliable system.
